			My music career has lasted a lot longer than my game-making career, to put it simply.
			<br><br>
			I started making songs in 2018, which is about 2 years before I started making games!
			<br>You can find my music YouTube channel (EJMusic) by clicking <a
				href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2Frnwv3NJZ2BQqWJhLeLhw">here</a>.
			<br>I may or may not have made the logo in about 5 minutes, and (at that time) did not think a background
			was needed.
			<br><br>Here, you can find all of the songs I haven't uploaded to my YouTube channel - including the Locked In Soundtrack.

				It didn't need many 𝓶𝓾𝓼𝓲𝓬𝓪𝓵 𝓵𝓪𝔂𝓮𝓻𝓼, because it was a chilled song. So I didn't add many.
