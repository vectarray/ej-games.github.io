		This page is dedicated to everything you need to know, as well as some unnecessary things, about me.

		<h4>Me</h4>
		I am a programmer, as well as some other things. Wow, I'm really not good at this.
		<br><br>You might know me as EJGames, or probably by my real name because the only people that visit this website are people that know me in real life. If that's not the
		case in the future, then hi, stranger!
		<br>I changed the website name from EJGames to Vectarray in October 2022 because EJGames is a bit dull, not creative, and limits what I can put up here. Vectarray is a much
		better name (in my opinion). It's not EJGames, which is kind of ew, to say the least, simply put.

		<br><br>I began making games in about 2015, using Scratch (I'll waffle on about that below), and then started using Unity in May-June 2020. From there, my interest in programming
		has definitely become a lot bigger - instead of my old asset-flip Roblox games, I started programming for them. I started making games from the ground-up. I started to understand
		programming fundamentals. And look at where we are now. It's probably pretty clear, but this website was solely created by me.


		<div class="smallSpace"></div><div class="line"></div>
		<h4>Timeline</h4>
		As I said above, I started making games in 2015. So here's a timeline of my entire history.

		<h3>16th October 1755</h3>
		I got a text from God, you know God? And he was like "Hi EJ you're going to be born now" and I was like "that's totes cool" and so I was born. That's how I came into this world.
		Just after that, I got another message saying "can you go to your computer and start making games?" and so I did that as well.
		<br><br>Sorry if I've just scared you off with that weird story. My sense of humour gets more normal as you hear more of it. Mainly because you get used to it. No, please, don't lea-

		<h3>2015/16</h3>
		I was young, I was foolish, and I couldn't stop making Scratch games. I was using an old Mac that struggled with Vanilla Minecraft, but do you think I really cared?
		No. I would also be lying if I said I was good at making Scratch games. My first few projects were just mazes. And quizzes. And some weird music video thing for a song that doesn't exist.

		<h3>2017/18</h3>
		I started writing music for the piano, by hand. Writing music by hand is very tedious and I would definitely recommend using something like MuseScore. Which is still tedious, but a lot less.
		My first song was called "The Beginning" which was definitely a very simple piece.
		<br>You can find my recent music <a href="/music.html">here</a> and my older music <a href="https://github.com/ej-games/EJMusic">here</a>.

		<br><br>This is the time I started my music YouTube channel and Spotify account. If you're that curious, just search for EJMusic on Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music, blah blah blah.

		<h3>2018/19</h3>
		Instead of just piano music, I started to compose electronic music, using GarageBand for iOS. My first songs were just built-in loops, and then progressed to built-in loops with some of my own
		music, and then just my music that I performed. All of my electronic music is available on Spotify and YouTube.

		<h3>2020</h3>
		I started using Unity to make games. As expected, my first games weren't the best, like a 3D quiz, and then a 2D platformer game. But I was improving. By the end of 2020, I started making
		a mobile game called Don't Think Of (which is the one game you can't play right now!), and it turned out quite advanced. I even tried to make it recently with JavaScript. Don't use JavaScript
		for number games. JavaScript does not support whole numbers. JavaScript also supports NaN. JavaScript is a pain. Yes it is. Now I will move on. The next section is coming now. If you want to
		read the next section, then it's here. This is transitioning to the next section. There is another section up ahead.

		<h3>2021</h3>
		My Unity games got a lot more advanced, like a PvE Zombie game (with 10%-complete storyline!).
		<br>I also started programming for Roblox games, which was a bit more difficult, but still
		so easy because I'm sooo smart.
		<br><br>I started using Ableton Live for my music (instead of GarageBand), and that was definitely a good choice. At first, my Ableton Live music was very very
		simple, mainly because I didn't know how to use the knobs and sliders and other gizmos.
		<br>Over the Summer of 2021, I programmed my most advanced Roblox game yet (called Obby Showdown) that had currency, monetisation, experience, abilities, and a bunch of other things - 
		for a parkour game.

		<h3>2022</h3>
		Unity development kind of slowed down. I mean, apart from the massive surge of Locked In updates at the start of the year. But throughout the year, game development has definitely slowed.
		My website is probably one of the reasons, as well as trying to put more time and effort into my music.
		<br>I am also making videos on another YouTube channel - but I'm not telling you the name of that one. Because it's irrelevant.

		<h3>2023</h3>
		Well sorry, but there's a bit of an important thing going on in my life right now (hint: SW18), so pretty much everything has stopped for the entire year. But I hope to get some more
		stuff going soon. Please, thank, bye.

		<h3>2024</h3>
		Whaat? You think I have enough time to continue working on a website as <b>well</b> as everything else?
		Well you'd be right for the most part.
		<br><br>But don't forget about the Blog page, where I'm posting reviews, updates, and more.

		<h3>2025</h3>
		The website is getting some much-needed love and attention. Assuming you didn't type "https://vectarray.com/about.html" straight into the search bar,
		you've already seen the changes to the homepage.
		<br><br>But wait until you see the music page! Ooh, what a lovely music discography navigator.

		<h3>Overview</h3>
		I think I'm doing quite well. Thanks.

		<h4>My Stuff</h4>
		You have been on the homepage already, haven't you? So you've probably seen all of this before. Unless I change it, which is pretty likely.

		<div class="cards bigger">

			<div class="whole-width-card">
				<h4>3D Quiz</h4>
				<div class="left" style="width: 55%">
					<be>Gameplay</be><br>
					In this really creative game, you would control a cube (yes, just a cube) and move it onto platforms to answer quiz questions. It had 10 questions that were all ripped
					from other websites and previous quizzes I had made.
				</div>
				<div class="right" style="width: 40%">
					<be>Creation & Inspiration</be><br>
					It was my first game that wasn't following a tutorial. I was pretty happy with it at the time. Even though it was (and still is) really boring to play.
				</div>

			<div class="whole-width-card">
				<h4>2D Platformer<br><sml>AKA "Generic Platformer / Platform√©"</sml></h4>
				<div class="left" style="width: 55%">
					<be>Gameplay</be><br>
					Another really creative game! Featuring 10 levels, again!
