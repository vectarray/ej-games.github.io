		Welcome to the second technology review from Vectarray, this time reviewing the great compact Canon Ixus 185.
		<br>Of course, it's lovely. In fact, it was the first camera I owned, and was very practical indeed.

		<div class="divider"></div>
		<h4>Technical Specs</h4>
		<img class="leftImage image-zoom" src="/blog/images/240923canon-ixus-185-front.jpg" style="width: 40%;">
		<br>This amazing camera features:
		<ul style="overflow: auto; margin-top: 0;">
			<li>8x optical zoom</li>
			<li>20 MP sensor (5164x3873 at 4:3)</li>
			<li>Automatic scene detection</li>
			<li>Continuous autofocus</li>
			<li>720p HD video at 30fps</li>
			<li>ISO sensitivity up to 1600</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="clear"></div>
		Only 1% of readers will notice that the specs for this camera are very similar to the Nikon Coolpix L340, because essentially,
		the Nikon is just this camera with a bigger barrel. When you take this camera outside to film random people for entertainment,
		you tend look less like a professional photographer, and more like a pervert.
		<br><br>
		And, unlike the Nikon, this features a whole rechargeable battery! Which, despite being about 3 years old, with barely any use
		for the latest year, it still holds a decent charge.

		<h4>Image Quality</h4>
		This camera has a reasonable camera quality, with fairly rich colours. However, like most mini cameras, it's got a problem
		with noise, especially when at the highest optical zoom. Might just be me. But who cares what you think? You didn't spend 10 minutes
		writing some gibberish on an HTML document.<br><br>

		<img class="image-zoom" style="width: 100%" src="/blog/images/240923canon-ixus-185-demo-landscape.JPG">
		<img class="image-zoom" style="width: 100%" src="/blog/images/240923canon-ixus-185-demo-toy.JPG">
		This bottom photo was taken using the Toy or Closeup preset, of a stretch of the M4. I don't know, I just saw the timelapses with
		this filter on TV and thought it was cool.

		<h3>Video Quality</h3>
		The video quality in and of itself is OK, at 720p. But, being a small camera, your hands tend to be more shaky, and less
		dampened than they would with a bigger, heavier camera.
		<br><br>Before I was careful about being stable holding the camera, I wanted to film a quick tour of a holiday home I had
		rented, just to go in the holiday folder. But the instability was so bad that it was hard to watch. So be careful.


		<div class="divider"></div>

		<h4>Ease of Use</h4>
		Very easy to use. Although the buttons are small, they are straightforward, and unambiguous.
		<br>Button prompts are always visible somewhere, and, unlike the Nikon, it doesn't require 500 steps to delete multiple photos!!
		<br><br>The only problem I have is the time it takes to fully switch the camera on and take a photo.
		<br>Say you see a bird, or a squirrel,
		and because you're a noob photographer, you don't have a photo of a squirrel yet. So you reach into your trouser pocket and take out the camera,
		then it takes a second or two to switch on the camera.
		<br>Then it takes another second or so to load the image.
		<br>Then it takes a couple of seconds for the zoom motor to get ready and zoom to the right amount.
		<br>Then it has to focus (another one or two seconds)
		<br>And where has the squirrel gone?

		<h4>Conclusion</h4>
		Can you comment on this, please.

		<h5>Ratings</h5>
		New: <b>8</b>/10
		<br><br>
		Beginner-friendly: <b>9</b>/10
		<br><br>
		Easy to use: <b>9</b>/10
		<br><br>
		High-quality images: <b>6</b>/10
		<br><br>
		<b>Overall: 8</b>/10
		<br><br>Obviously not an 8/10 for a professional photographer. But honestly, if you're a professional photographer reading this,
		what are you even doing? Go and read Camera Weekly or whatever your bland magazine is called.
