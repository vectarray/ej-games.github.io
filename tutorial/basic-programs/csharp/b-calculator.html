	<h2>C# Calculator</h2>
	<div class="smallSpace"></div>
	<div class="mainParagraph">

		This is how you make a rudimentary calculator with C#. Obviously there are many ways to make a calculator, and this is just one of them.
		<br>In this tutorial, you will learn how to take input and perform basic operations. As much as it pains me to say this, there will be a
		link to the full project at the end, as well as the full program.
		
		<div class="divider"></div>
		<h4>Asking the big questions</h4>
		The first thing you want to do when making a calculator program is, well, prompt the user for a number. Easy:
<pre><code class="language-csharp">Console.WriteLine("What's the first number?");
</code></pre>
		and yes, it is that easy. Make sure to include the semicolon, or VSCode will complain.
		<br><br>But the possibly confusing part comes when you ask for input.
<pre><code class="language-csharp">string firstInput = Console.ReadLine();
</code></pre>
		What's effectively going on here is:
		<ol>
			<li>
				Create a variable of a "string" type, which is basically text
			</li>
			<li>
				Call it "firstInput"
			</li>
			<li>
				Set it to the result of checking the console
			</li>
		</ol>
		Apologies if you already knew how that worked. But also, at the same time, no apologies. You're the one reading it.
		<br><br>Depending on your version of .NET, there could be a complaint from VSCode underneath <code>Console.ReadLine()</code>.
		<br>It'll be complaining that the <code>Console.ReadLine()</code> could give you a bad value. But in this case, the value will
		always be fine.
		<br>
		For the time being, especially when working in VSCode, you can shut it up by putting an exclamation mark after the <code>()</code>. This
		effectively tells VSCode: "I'm sure that the result will always be fine, but just in case it isn't, stop the program."
		<br><br>Now, if you run the program, it should give the following output:
<pre><code class="language-txt">What's the first number?
&gt;
</code></pre>
		If you type anything, then press enter, the program will stop.

		<div class="divider"></div>
		<h4>Turning it into a number</h4>
		Right now, the variable <code>firstInput</code> is a string, or a piece of text. If you input "7", the computer
		will treat it like any other piece of text, so you can't perform any mathematical operations on it.
		<br><br>What you need to do is turn it into an integer, also called an <code>int</code>.
		<br><br>Turning text into an integer is easy:
<pre><code class="language-csharp">int firstNumber = int.Parse(firstInput);	
</code></pre>

		This creates a new integer variable called <code>firstNumber</code>, then sets it to the result of converting
		<code>firstInput</code> to an integer.
		<br><br><code>int.Parse()</code> effectively allows you to convert anything you want into an integer, provided there's
		a straightforward way for the computer to do it. Obviously you can't convert the word "apple" to an integer, but you can
		convert the number "4".

		<h3>Problem 1</h3>
		Right now, if you run the program, and type in a number, it works as expected - just stops the program after pressing Enter.
		<br>But if you run it again, and instead of typing a number, type in a word, the program will instead say something like:
		<br><br>
<div class="code">Exception thrown: 'System.FormatException' in System.Private.CoreLib.dll</div>
		<br>Which just means that there's a formatting error in your input, that originates from a file called System.Private.CoreLib (basically,
		you've spoiled the party by typing a word).
		<br><br>There are of course many ways to fix this.

		<h5>Solution 1</h5>
		Add a <code>try</code> and <code>catch</code> block to prevent the errors.
		<br><br>A 'try' block is run normally, until there is an error, in which case, the 'try' block is aborted and the program skips straight
		to the catch block. To implement it in our program, you can do:
<pre><code class="language-csharp">int firstNumber = 0;

try {
	firstNumber = int.Parse(firstInput);
}
catch {
	firstNumber = 1;
	// Set a default value to stop the program from ending.
}
</code></pre>
		and that does solve the problem of the program ending.

		<h5>Solution 2</h5>
		C# has a special function you can use instead of <code>int.Parse()</code>, called <code>int.TryParse()</code>. Instead of
		returning a number, it returns either 'true' or 'false'. If you pass it a valid number, it returns true. If not, it returns false.
		In this case, you would use it as follows:
<pre><code class="language-csharp">int firstNumber = 0;
if(int.TryParse(firstInput, out int parsedValue)) {
	// Code in here will only run if the input is a number
	firstNumber = parsedValue;
}
else {
	firstNumber = 1;
}
</code></pre>
		The <code>out int parsedValue</code> effectively creates an integer variable inside the function, which is quite useful especially
		when you make your own functions.
		<br><br>
		This code is slightly cleaner than the other solution, but has basically the same effect.

		<h4>Selecting the operation</h4>
		After you take the integer, you'll need the user to select the operation they want to perform.
		I would recommend only including adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing, but it's fairly easy to add more.
