					Features an electric guitar, some synth choirs and sounds quite empty (not much going on).
					<br>I would say this is ALMOST a step up from the last one. Although it's got a similar
					number of tracks going at once, it still has a more interesting beat and is less repetitive.

					which I just clicked and dragged to the song.
					<br>I made it just after the weird Sad Hannah one. At this point I was just proving to myself
